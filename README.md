# blogs-maven #

This is just a place for me to keep sample code from blogposts that I follow
along with.  I've separated Java blogposts into three categories.  
blogs-java, blogs-jee, and blogs-spring.
I've also made a blogs-clojure repo for when I follow along with clojure
blogs, and I've added a blogs-scala too.  Kotlin projects will probably end up
in blogs-gradle, since they don't really have an associated buildtool.  They
might be mixed into maven too.  I read blogs on a lot of different topics, but I
haven't been saving all my work.  Hopefully with the projects in one place, I'll
have a reliable way to refresh my memory about something I read once.

I've been doing one repo per course when following along with courses, but this
is simply unsustainable with blogposts, since there are so many.
