## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

You can use the
[Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)
plugin to run the app:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then you can browse to <http://localhost:8080/> to begin working with the demo
showing several spring-security-thymeleaf functions.

user/password has USER privileges and admin/admin has ADMIN.
